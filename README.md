# Project Overview :

The project involves designing and developing creating a Flask-based web application that allows users to organize and manage information in the form of a task tracker or a similar tool for managing tasks, notes, study plans, or other records.

Project Name
Task  Trackr (Productivity Web App)
Short Overview
Task Trackr is a lightweight Flask web app that helps students/users track tasks in one place. It focuses on core productivity features (view, add, complete, delete tasks) without accounts, databases, or heavy styling.
MVP Description
Our app is a lightweight task tracker that helps users quickly organize what they need to work on. It solves the problem of losing track of to-dos across multiple categories. The intended users are students or persons who want a simple way to list tasks and see what’s next. The primary action is adding a task and viewing it in a list. Users can mark tasks complete when finished and delete tasks they no longer need. The app keeps the experience minimal by avoiding accounts, databases, and complex design. The MVP is still useful because it provides a single place to record tasks and track completion status. If time allows, tasks will be saved to a simple JSON file so they persist after restarting the program.
